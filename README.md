# Analysis-of-bigbasket.com
This project aims to analyze product sales data from the bigbasket.com platform, focusing on understanding market dynamics and product performance. I have used the Kaggle data set for this analysis. The analysis involves several key metrics and insights:  


-- Calculate the rank of products within each category based on their sale price.

 -- Determine the difference between the sale price of each product and the average sale price of products in its category.

-- Rank products within each sub-category based on their market price.

-- Identify the top-rated product in each category, along with its rating.

-- Calculate the cumulative sum of sale prices for products within each brand, ordered by sale price.

-- Determine the percentage contribution of each product's sale price to the total sale price of its category.
